### Production Email Configuration
- **SMTP settings** configured for production deployment
- **Environment variable support** for email providers
- **Delivery error handling** and notifications
- **Email template optimization** for various clients

## âœ… Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **System tests** for complete user onboarding flow
- **Request tests** for onboarding controller actions
- **Factory definitions** for test data creation
- **RSpec integration** with existing test suite

### Development Environment
- **Database seeds** with sample data
- **Development user accounts** pre-configured
- **Organization setup** for immediate testing

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

### Server Setup
1. **Launch AWS EC2 instance** (Ubuntu 20.04+)
2. **Configure DNS** to point to EC2 instance
3. **Set environment variables** in `.env` file
4. **Configure SSH keys** for deployment user

### Database Setup
Choose one:
- **Option A**: Use local PostgreSQL (automatic installation)
- **Option B**: Use AWS RDS (set DATABASE_HOST)

### Email Configuration
1. **Configure SMTP settings** (Gmail/SendGrid/etc.)
2. **Set email environment variables**
3. **Test email delivery** in production

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Set your server hostname
export DEPLOY_SERVER=your-server.example.com

# First deployment (includes system setup)
bundle exec cap production deploy:setup
bundle exec cap production deploy

# Setup NGINX with SSL
bundle exec cap production nginx:setup
bundle exec cap production ssl:generate_self_signed

# Subsequent deployments
bundle exec cap production deploy
```

### Post-Deployment
1. **Replace self-signed SSL** with Let's Encrypt certificate
2. **Configure backup strategy** for database
3. **Set up monitoring** and alerts
4. **Test complete user flow** from registration to dashboard

## âœ¨ User Experience Flow

### New Organization (First User)
