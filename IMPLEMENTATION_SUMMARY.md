- **Feature benefits overview** with checkmarks
- **Visual feedback** for validation errors

#### Step 3: Completion
- **Success confirmation** with organization details
- **Next steps guidance** with direct action buttons:
  - Go to Dashboard
  - Upload Tests
  - Invite Team Members
- **Help resources** and support information

### Technical Implementation
- **Database migration**: Added `onboarding_completed_at` to users
- **User model methods**: `onboarding_completed?`, `needs_onboarding?`
- **Dashboard integration**: Automatic redirection for incomplete onboarding
- **Route configuration**: Clean URLs for onboarding flow

### UI/UX Excellence
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Visual progress indicators** showing current step
- **Contextual help text** and guidance

- **Delivery error handling** and notifications
- **Email template optimization** for various clients

## âœ… Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **System tests** for complete user onboarding flow
- **Request tests** for onboarding controller actions
- **Factory definitions** for test data creation
- **RSpec integration** with existing test suite

### Development Environment
- **Database seeds** with sample data
- **Development user accounts** pre-configured
- **Organization setup** for immediate testing

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

### Server Setup
1. **Launch AWS EC2 instance** (Ubuntu 20.04+, minimum 2GB RAM)
2. **Configure security group** (ports 22, 80, 443)
3. **Configure DNS** to point to EC2 instance
4. **Set environment variables** in `.env` file
5. **Configure SSH keys** for deployment user

### Database Setup
Choose one:
- **Option A**: Use local PostgreSQL (automatic installation)
- **Option B**: Use AWS RDS (set DATABASE_HOST)

### SSL Certificate Setup
Choose one:
- **Option A**: Let's Encrypt (recommended) - set `USE_LETSENCRYPT=true`
- **Option B**: Self-signed (development) - leave `USE_LETSENCRYPT` unset

### Email Configuration
1. **Configure SMTP settings** (Gmail/SendGrid/etc.)
2. **Set email environment variables**
3. **Test email delivery** in production

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Configure environment
cp config/deploy/templates/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Initial deployment (complete automation)
export DEPLOY_SERVER=your-server.example.com
export USE_LETSENCRYPT=true
export LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
bundle exec cap production deploy:initial

# Subsequent deployments
bundle exec cap production deploy
```

### Post-Deployment
1. **Replace self-signed SSL** with Let's Encrypt certificate
2. **Configure backup strategy** for database
3. **Set up monitoring** and alerts
4. **Test complete user flow** from registration to dashboard

## âœ¨ User Experience Flow

### New Organization (First User)
